# Tasmota Arduino PlatformIO framework builder [![ESP32 builder](https://github.com/Jason2866/esp32-arduino-lib-builder/actions/workflows/parallel_build.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Jason2866/esp32-arduino-lib-builder/actions/workflows/parallel_build.yaml)[![GitHub Releases](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/Jason2866/esp32-arduino-lib-builder/total?label=downloads)](https://github.com/Jason2866/esp32-arduino-lib-builder/releases/latest)

This repository contains the scripts that produce the libraries included with Tasmota esp32-arduino.

Tested on Ubuntu and MacOS.

### Build on Ubuntu
```bash
sudo apt-get install git wget curl libssl-dev libncurses-dev flex bison gperf python python-pip python-setuptools python-serial python-click python-cryptography python-future python-pyparsing python-pyelftools cmake ninja-build ccache jq
sudo pip install --upgrade pip
git clone https://github.com/espressif/esp32-arduino-lib-builder
cd esp32-arduino-lib-builder
./build.sh
```

### Using the User Interface

You can more easily build the libraries using the user interface found in the `tools/config_editor/` folder.
It is a Python script that allows you to select and edit the options for the libraries you want to build.
The script has mouse support and can also be pre-configured using the same command line arguments as the `build.sh` script.
For more information and troubleshooting, please refer to the [UI README](tools/config_editor/README.md).

To use it, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have the following prerequisites:
  - Python 3.10 or later
  - All the dependencies listed in the previous section

2. Install the required UI packages using `pip install -r tools/config_editor/requirements.txt`.

3. Execute the script `tools/config_editor/app.py` from any folder. It will automatically detect the path to the root of the repository.

4. Configure the compilation and ESP-IDF options as desired.

5. Click on the "Compile Static Libraries" button to start the compilation process.

6. The script will show the compilation output in a new screen. Note that the compilation process can take many hours, depending on the number of libraries selected and the options chosen.
